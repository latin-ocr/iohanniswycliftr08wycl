xxx INTRODUCTION.

Beneath this in a hand in the fifteenth century is
written: W.1 5, followed by the words: Liber Pauli de
Slam'kowicz. This Paulus de Slawikowicz is mentioned
in the Monumenta Histor. Universitatis Pragensis Î™.
300, as having taken his Bachelor's degree at Prague in
13953 his ownership of the MS. agrees well with its
handwriting, which is that of the beginning of the
fifteenth century.

From the foregoing description of the two MSS. it
will be seen that MS. 3933 is probably the earlier os the
tim, and experience has shown that it is also the better.
It has therefore been freely used to correct the mistakes
of MS. 4514, but the collations at the foot of each page
enable the reader to see at a glance the reading of both
manuscripts wherever they differ. It is needless to say
that Dr. Stange's transcript of MS. 4514 was made with
absolute faithfulness. The Editors have, however, found
it necessary to completely revise the punctuation, and
they have also thought it well to distinguish proper
names by initial capitals. In all other respects MS.
4514, as amended by 3933, has been faithfully followed.
