xiv INTRODUCTION.

either authorization or official negligence on the part
of rulers. The second attack against the royal authority
is based on the contention that the King is subject to
and ruled by law. This is well answered by the dis-
tinction between law as the embodiment of truth and
reason and law as ordained for the government of a civil
dominion. The first law is divine and obligatory on all
rnen, and even on Christ; the second law is human, in
the king’s power, and only obligatory upon him by
virtue of the commands of the higher law. Thus the
King is not subject to his law, but must yet conform to
it for higher reasons, must set an example of obedience,
and honour, and protect all men according to their
respective classes. In the lower ranks this protectior]
will be chiefly as to their temporal goods, save that in
times of necessity the King (always with discretion) may
use the property of his subjects as his own. But this
protection of temporalities will not extend to the irn-
properly held clerica] endowrnents.

The third objection (p. 98) to the theories thus ex-
pressed rests on the assumed inconsistency between
Christ’s religion and the obligation upon subjects to
obey their King no less implicitly than a monk his
abbot. Wyclif begins his answer by showing that the
merit in obedience considered simpliciter consists not in
the worthiness or unworthiness of the person obeyed
but in the degree of charity or grace of the person
obeying. The question, however, is not one of obedience
regarded simplicz'ler but of a special case, and his oppo-
nents are made to argue (i) that the spirit excels the
flesh, and the monk must obey his abbot as he would
Christ, but need not so obey his king, and (ii) that the
abbot rnay give unreasonable commands for the sake
of trying his monk's obedience, but that the obligation
to obey the king is confined to a small and limited kind
os service. As against this it is shown that a loyal
priest is bound to obey his King, (a) on more numerous
