INTRODUCTION. xxix

The De Officio Regis is at present extant in three
manuscripts, viz, Vienna 4514 and 3933, and Prague
X. D. 11. Our text is founded on a transcript of the
first of these made by Dr. O. Stange for the Wyclif
Society. With this transcript Dr. Hertzberg-Fr'ankel
has collated for the Society MS. Vienna 3933, and it
is also from his notes that we are able to give the
following description of the two MSS.

MS. Vienna 4514. Quoted as A.

On paper (first and last leaves parchment), small 4to.
Bound in wood covered with leather. On the first leaf
is written : Super Cantica Canac, and then in a different
writing: lVyeleph de blasfemia officio regis. On fol.
86 the copyist of the De Blasphemia has written the
date: circa penthecosles sub a. d. 1432, and signed his
name: Wstrach. The De Officio Regis occupies ff.
105-182 of the MS„ and is written in a firm and
practised hand of the first half of the fifteenth century, in
the opinion of Dr. Hertzberg-Fr'ankel identical with that
of the De Blasplzemz'cz. The De Officz'o Regis is pre-
ceded by three leaves, ff. 102-4, containing an alpha-
betical catalogue of lVyclif's works‚ and followed by an
abridgment of the treatise headed: Senlencz‘cz de officio
regis in compendio st'c habelur, occupying ff. 183-4.

MS. Vienna 3933. Quoted as B.

In double columns, marked in this edition a, b, c, d, sor
each leaf, with a division into paragraphs by means of
letters in red ink in the margin (A, B, C, ete). The
text is preceded by a table os the contents of the different
chapters, and followed by an alphabetically arranged
index. At the foot of the page there is occasionally a
gloss, apparently in the same hand as the text. On the
inside of the cover at the top of the page a hand of the
second half of the fifteenth century has written:

Versa Berengarium, fuge Wicleff, cede Rikardum,
Implicet hic errat, hic sacramenta retractat.
