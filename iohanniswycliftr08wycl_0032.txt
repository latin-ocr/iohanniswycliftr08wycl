xxviii INTRODUCTION.

to our treatise having followed immediately upon its
predecessor. Thus the controversy as to the privileges
of the Sanctuary of westminster¹ is twice alluded to
(pp. 157 and 169), but in a manner which allows us to
imagine that at the time Wyclif was writing public
interest on the subject had greatly subsided. The
schism in the papacy is several times mentioned (pp.
120, 17; 121, 13; 123, 63 126, 3¹; 219, 25; 226, 7).
The first of these references shows that Urban's Bull of
November 1378 had already been issued ; in the second
there is a difficulty in the text which may lead to slightly
different views. According to our MSS. Wyclif writes :
et revera latet πω· ulrum lpse [se. Robertus Gibornensis,
i. e. Clement VII] vel Gregorius A⁷J⁸⁴⁸ occupat palri-
moninm Cristi iniustius. It has been suggested that
Gregorius (VIM is here a slip of the pen for Urbanus
VIM, in which case Wyclif at the time of writing was
already disabused of the good hopes of Urban which he
had conceived at the time of his election. On the other
hand a few lines further down Urban is distinctly
spoken osas papa noster, and it seems at least possible
to construe the text as it stands, taking its meaning to
be: ‘and it is hard to say whether the present Anti-
pope is a worse usurper than was his legitimate prede-
cessor.' In any case the difference of date cannot be
important, for in one passage of the De Ecclesia wyclif
had already classed Pope and Antipope together as
duo pseudomonachi. The remaining references to the
schism are quite general in termS, and an allusion to the
poor soldiers still unransomcd in Spain perfectly har-
monizes with the date 1379 which the connexion of
this eighth book of the Summa with its immediate
predecessor inclines us to assign to it.

Ecclcsz'a. The breaeh os the Ahbey's privilege os sanctuary took place on
August mh, 1378. On the lSth of the following October Wyclis laid

before the Parliament at Gloucester a memorial in which he defended the
action of the (jove-minent.
